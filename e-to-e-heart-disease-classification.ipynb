    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into usiong various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modeling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from Cleaveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease/\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at pretending whether or not a patient has heart disease or not during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.\n",
